%% Part 1

%  1.                
% Having empty shelves during times of high demand, and having empty shelves
% during times of low demand can be a huge loss to grocery
% stores like Walmart. It is often hard to predict whether
% demand will rise or drop during a holiday season, So I
% developed a machine learning algorithm that can accurately predict whether the demand for goods in Walmart
% will increase or decrease during different holiday seasons throughout the year by taking into account
% outdoor temperature, feul price, CPI and Unemployment rates.


%   2. 
% The source of the data: https://www.kaggle.com/rutuspatel/retail-analysis-with-walmart-sales-data
% The data provides Weekly Sales, Outdoor Temperature, Fuel Price, CPI, and Unemployment reates
% all as type Double. Store number as an Integer (1 through 45), and
% Holiday Flag as an integer (0 and 1), for this analysis I will only be
% examining holiday seasons (Flag = 1). 
% Lastly, the Date is loaded onto Matlab as a date-time value.

opts.VariableTypes{:,2} = 'datetime';
data = readtable(fileName,opts);

%pre processing data
data.Date = DatetoToy(data.Date);   % custom function call
la = data.Holiday_Flag == 1;
dsdT = ChangeinSales(la,data);  % custom function call
incSales = dsdT > 0;
for i=1:length(incSales)-1
    incSales(1,i) = incSales(1,i+1);
end
feat = data(la,:);
feat.incSales = categorical(incSales(1:end-1)');
storeavgsales = zeros(1,45);
for i = 1:size(storeavgsales,2)
    storeavgsales(1,i) = StoreAverageSales(data,i);  % custom function call
end
feat.highavg = zeros(450,1);
for i = 1:45
    la = feat.Store == i;
    feat(la,10) = array2table(table2array(feat(la,3))-storeavgsales(1,i));
end
la = feat.Store < 23;
traindata = feat(la,:);
testdata = feat(~la,:);

% In the processing stage the datetime values were converted into a value
% 1-365 (day of Year). Two new categories were introduced: 

%incSales, which is what will be predicted. True means the sales will
%increase, False means the sales will decrease.

% highavg: the difference between the weekly sales in a given week, 
% and the average weekly for that store. 



% Knn classification model is used because classes can be seperated into
% neighboring regions when predictors are plotted against each other as
% shown in the figures below.

gscatter(feat.highavg,feat.Weekly_Sales, feat.incSales)

%% Part 3 

% A pattern Recognition neural network was used because a pattern starts to
% unfold as the weekly sales are compared to the time of year for each store.
% the figure below shows a sample of 50 data points in different stores, and 
% a general pattern appears for when the sales are likely to increase. 

x = table2array(testdata(1:50,2));
y = table2array(testdata(1:50,3));

p = plot(x,y);

ylabel("Weekly Sales");
